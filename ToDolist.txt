Control power to the motor

Determine position of motor shaft

Store position of motor shaft in non volatile memory

Sleep/wake arduino through bluetooth module interrupts

Rotate motor through specified angles

Cut the power to the motor after action is completed

Determine excessive current that flows for specified period of time and cut off power to motor (prevent motor damage)

Alert users (sound/vision?) about the excessive current (which could be due to excessive load encountered by 
motor as the door is improperly aligned with its slot)

Alert users when battery is getting low.

While turning when excessive load is encountered, intelligently increase the motor torque to overcome the excessive load, 
then get back to lower torque as SimSim moves the lock to locked/unlocked position.
